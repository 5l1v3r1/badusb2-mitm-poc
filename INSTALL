WARNING:
This is ALPHA code only! As this project is only a proof of concept it is not meant to be used in real life situations but rather to expand the industries awareness into USB-HID MITM attacks and what may be possible. The code is also provided to aid other security researchers who may want to look into this space.

LIMITATIONS:
The USB-HID enumeration was tested on Windows targets and will likely not work for other operating-systems without a fair bit of tweaking.

The code hardcodes the USB endpoint so if your keyboard uses something other than EP1-OUT then you will need to modify it.

If your keyboard is more than just a keyboard the other USB functions will not work as the Facedancer's have a limited number of endpoints that you can MITM.

HARDWARE NEEDED:
x1 Linux build (tested on default install of Ubuntu 14.04)
x1 Windows XP/7 (our target)
x2 Facedancers
x3 USB type A-male to USB Mini-B cables
x1 USB Keyboard (tested on HP & Genius brands)

SETUP WALKTHROUGH:
The main requirement is the FTDI USB/Serial adapter (ftdi_sio modules) which "should" be installed by default on Ubuntu 14.04.

When connecting a Facedancer you should get:
$ dmesg 
-- snipped --
[ 1725.385252] usb 1-4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[ 1725.385256] usb 1-4: Product: FT232R USB UART
[ 1725.385259] usb 1-4: Manufacturer: FTDI
[ 1725.385262] usb 1-4: SerialNumber: AI02BP4J
[ 1725.398297] ftdi_sio 1-4:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
[ 1725.398351] usb 1-4: Detected FT232RL
[ 1725.403446] usb 1-4: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0

If this is the first time using the Facedancer's you will need to flash your devices so follow the goodfet tutorial found here:
http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/tutorial/

You will need to repeat the above steps twice, one for each Facedancer. 

When both Facedancers are attached to the MITM system you should now have two devices registered:
$ ls /dev/TTYUSB*
/dev/ttyUSB0  /dev/ttyUSB1

*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
Before running the BadUSB2 m2p/m2h scripts ensure the Facedancer 2 peripheral is connected first so it registers on '/dev/ttyUSB0'.

To run it we need to terminals open:
# Run on the first terminal (run this first)
sudo ./m2p.py info 
# Run on the second terminal
sudo ./m2h.py 

I've noticed on some Windows builds that you need to re-run the python scripts in order to get the operating-system to register the keyboard. I haven't looked into why this is.
